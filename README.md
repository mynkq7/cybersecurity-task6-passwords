Cybersecurity Internship Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation
Objective:
The goal of this task was to understand what makes a password strong and evaluate password strength using free online tools.
Tools Used:
- Password strength checker: [passwordmeter.com](http://passwordmeter.com/)
Passwords Tested and Result
Alex123
Score: 53%
Complexity: Good

AlexWithme123
Score: 88%
Complexity: Very Strong

AleXwithMe123
Score: 92%
Complexity: Very Strong

AleXwith@Me123
Score: 100%
Complexity: Very Strong

Explanation
- Alex123: Basic password with lowercase letters and numbers but lacks symbols and small length, resulting in good strength.
- AlexWithme123: Increased length and mixed case letters improved the strength significantly.
- AleXwithMe123: Further complexity by mixing uppercase letters within the password enhances security.
- AleXwith@Me123: Adding a special character (@) makes the password very strong, achieving the highest score.

Key Learnings
- Password strength depends on a combination of length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and unpredictability.
- Longer passwords with mixed character types are harder to crack by brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Even small changes, like adding a symbol, can greatly improve password strength.
- Avoid using easily guessable information such as personal info
- Use password managers and enable multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
